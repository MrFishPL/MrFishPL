# 👋 Hi, I’m Michał Karp  

> *Seeking to understand intelligence.*

I’m an 18-year-old researcher exploring the frontiers of **artificial intelligence**, particularly **world models** and the **foundations of reasoning**.  
Currently, I’m pursuing **research collaborations** and **on-site opportunities** in the **USA** or **UK** to deepen my work on generalization and reasoning in AI systems.
